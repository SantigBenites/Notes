# Intrusion Tolerance Concepts

Risk is as usually defined by $RISK = VUlNERABILTY * THREAT$
The correct assessment of how secure a system is, is therefore defined by
- How many vulnerabilities it was
- How many threats it is exposed to
we should also take into account that it isn't our goal to remove risk from a system, because it might not be possible, we should just try to reduce it to a manageable level.


The concept of "all-or-nothing security" should be replaced by "more-or-less security"
Which means we should have an understanding of which parts of our system are secure and which aren't
This concept is defined as coverage

We can also define trust and trustworthiness as concepts that are present in a secure system
- Trust is defined as a component of the system trusting that another component can be relied upon to have a set of properties
- Trustworthiness is defined as how much another component can trust said component to have a set of properties

# Concepts

## Fault Models

As we know a fault occurs when:

![[Pasted image 20230324144521.png|500]] ![[Pasted image 20230324144739.png|500]]

But this methodology can be extended when evaluating faults propagated through systems
Consider a situation when:
- Malicious attacker attacks some host
- Compromises host
- Takes control of the host
- Attacks the distributed system
Take also into consideration, this type of models try to specify the attacker behaviours, which is more easily said than done considering it is nigh impossible to determine every possible course of action for a human attacker.
So this is the reason we almost always consider that the machines can be compromised.

## Methodologies

There are multiple methodologies for achieving trustworthiness
- Attack Prevention - Preventing certain components from being attacked 
- Attack Removal - Taking measures to remove attacks that already took place
- Vulnerability Prevention - Making sure vulnerabilities don't appear in certain components
- Vulnerability Removal - Removing vulnerabilities from components

## Error Processing

The process of error processing is composed of 3 major components
- Error detection - Detecting an error after it occurs, with the intent of avoiding its propagation
- Error recovery - Recovering from an error to remedy its consequences
- Error masking - Adding redundancy to the system so error can happen without consequences to the overall system

## Fault Processing

Consider that a fault/vulnerability is defined as the entry point by which an intrusion occurs 
The process of fault processing is composed of 3 steps
- Diagnosis - Determine the location of the fault
- Isolation - Prevent new activation of the fault
- Reconfiguration - Reconfigure the component to remove the fault

# Framework

We will now evaluate the tools that can be used to build intrusion tolerant systems

## Secure and fault tolerant communication
Regarding protocols used to ensure secure communication across the system
- Secure channels like TLS
- Fault tolerant group communication

## Software-based intrusion tolerance
Used to tolerate different types of faults
- Tolerate hardware faults
- Tolerate design faults
The main goal is to defeat against common mode faults (A common mode failure (CMF) is defined as the simultaneous failure of several components due to a single external cause)
Using diverse components can also be employed to defend against CMF
Because the need to master multiple system usually deters attackers.

## Hardware-based intrusion tolerance
Usually means to build hardware which is fail-controlled, which means, a system which are very unlikely to compromise
This type of behaviour improves overall trustworthiness, and usually the only way for them to fail is by crashing
The main draw back from this approach is the cost in resources and time needed to use their algorithms.

## Auditing
The routine logs are normally useful for posterior use, when trying to determine the causes of an attack
These are crucial to trace back event to their origin
For them to serve their purpose it is essential that they are tamper-proof, blockchains can be used to defend from possible tampering

## Intrusion Detection (ID)
Consists in all kinds of attempts at trying to detect the presence of an intrusion, usually performed in real time

# Strategies
System construction 
- Fault avoidance + Fault tolerance  
System goals (pick one or more of these)  
- Confidential operation  
- Perfect non-stop operation  
- Reconfigurable operation  
- Recoverable operation (e.g., disaster recovery)  
- Fail-safe
