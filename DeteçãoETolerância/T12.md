# Hybrid Consensus

Hybrid consensus protocols are a type of blockchain which tries to get the best features from both Permissioned and Permissionless blockchains.

They do this by using a Permissionless blockchain protocol based on both Nakamoto and BFT consensus.

These are usually implemented using 2 blockchains

- One for defining committee members, which order transactions
- Other used for ordering the transactions

In this types of blockchains there are 2 different types of users

- Users that participate in adding transactions
- Users that participate in consensus

## Protocol

To this effect the protocol goes as follows
- Producers of the last n blocks are members of a committee
- With a quorum of signatures from the committee a block is validated
- Each committee creates a "daily" blockchain with the transactions it validated
- The daily chain is added to the blockchain

## Hybrid Blockchain

Requires
- Synchronous system (similar to Nakamoto)
- Less than $1/3$ byzantine nodes
- Node corruption takes time T

The size of the committee and duration of the "day" are proportional to T

# Payment without consensus

Lately it has been shown that the consensus number for a cryptocurrency is 1.

This means 2 things
- We cant solve consensus using a cryptocurrency
- We don't need to solve consensus to implement a decentralized cryptocurrency

Using this fact Astro was created

# Astro

Astro is an implementation of a cryptocurrency which solves double spending without solving consensus

The system model it requires is as follows
- Asynchronous system
- $n > 3f$ replicas being f the maximum number of byzantine replicas
- Standard cryptographic assumptions

Protocol
- Users submit payment requests to a representative
- Payments are disseminated through the network using Byzantine Reliable Broadcast
- Instead of using a single blockchain, each replica has an xlog for each user


I this situation the 2 blockchain in use by the hybrid algorithm contain
- Representatives which are allowed to justify transactions
- Values in each account

Only representatives can commit to the values blockchain and for a normal account to make a transaction it must pass through a representative

## Features

This allows astro to have
- Message complexity of $O(N)$
- Throughput robustness during crashes and failures
- Throughput robustness during assynchrony
