# Intrusion Detection (ID)

Intrusion detection, or ID, usually encompasses every attempt at detecting the presence of an intrusion on the system.
It can detect an intrusion or their consequences, like vulnerabilities or attacks.
It can be done in 2 ways
- Real-Time
- Off-line

## Common Intrusion Detection Framework (CIDF)

This is an attempt at making a common structure for the majority of all IDS's  it consists of 4 boxes
- e-box - gathers events
- a-box - analyses events
- d-box - saves IDS permanent information
- r-box - acts upon the analysis
The boxes are organised as such:

## Detection Mechanisms

The process of detection is 2 fold, because there are 2 main cases for the IDS to search for:
- Anomalies
- Misuses
For this exact purpose the IDS makes use of 2 reference pattern databases

When searching for anomalies it will take into consideration current system state and compare it to patterns of normal operation of the system
When searching for misuses it will take into consideration current system state and compare it to patterns of abnormal operation of the system
A single IDS is not limited to searching for a single type of case, usually systems are hybrids of these 2.
This is the example:

Take into account that there are multiple similarities between intrusion detection and signal detection

## IDS Quality of Service

There exists a lot of overlay between intrusion detection and classification problems studied in AI, such that ID can be considered an applied classification problem
In this way IDSes can be considered binary classifiers, trying to classify packets and flow as they satisfy a given property, the properties of being an intrusion.
This gives way to 2 new values to classify IDS
- False Positive - FP - when something is classified as having a property but in reality doesn't, it is also the opposite of True Positive - TP
- False Negative - FN - when something is classified as not having a property but in reality does, it is also the opposite of True Negative - TN
And leads to 2 new ways of classifying quality of the IDS service
- Sensitivity - Percentage of positive classification which is correct
- Specificity - Percentage of negative classification which is correct
The higher these values are the better, and they can go under 50% because of the nature of binary classifiers

In usual scenarios there is always a trade off between specificity and sensitivity, this trade off is represented by the ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic) where we plot sensitivity vs (1 - specificity)

Another fact we must take into account is the Base-Rate Fallacy
This fallacy relates that considering we are talking about 2 related probabilities
Consider an IDS with 99% true positive rate and 1% false positive rate.
- For every 10000 tests, we will have one alarm due to an attack (due to our 99% of sensitivity)  
- However, the FP rate of 1% implies that the system raises one false alarm for every 100 tests  
- In 10000 tests, 101 alarms will be raised, and only one is an attack!
In a nutshell in IDS we should strive to have low FP rates


# IDS Classes

There exist 2 main types of IDSes

## Behaviour Based IDS (or anomaly detection)
- Doesn't have knowledge of specific attacks
- Needs knowledge of the normal behaviour of the system
- Advantages 
	- Don't require Database of attack signatures
	- Can detect 0-day attacks
- Disadvantages
	- More potential false alarms
	- Doesn't provide information about type of attack

## Knowledge-based (or misuse detection)
- Uses a database of previously known attack signatures
- When a machine matches a signature it triggers an attack
- Advantages
	- Alarms can identify specific attack signatures
- Disadvantages
	- Doesn't stand 0-day attacks
	- Can miss some potential attack signatures

## 
Another category of IDS is where to deploy it

## Host-based vs. Network-based IDS

In Host-based
- The e-box is the host
- Collect information available to the host like duration of session and files accessed

In Network based IDS
- The e-box is the network
- Collects information available to the network, like packet information and headers


# Security Monitoring in Practice

In reality an IDS is just a component of a bigger security framework, which will take the alarm raised by the IDS and change the system to handle it appropriately.
Normally the chain of command goes:
$$ IDS \rightarrow Alerts \rightarrow (optional) SIEMS \rightarrow Security Analysts $$
In terms of the actual analysis the annalists do, it usually tries to determine why the system raised an alarm, and if the alarm stems from an attack or just a random use case.
Usually these are done manually by human analysts, but there are attempts to use Machine learning to simplify the actual human work

## Failure Detection

There is some overlay between Intrusion Detection and Failure Detection in distributed systems considering some intrusion can lead to crashes
This being said, there are attacks that can be undetectable, and therefore ID's are different from FD's in such a way.
This being said, the usage of FD as an ID can lead to recovery from attack if the intrusion leads to a crash, given that it is an FD main purpose to tolerate crashes.
