Lets revise some important concepts
- Trust - A relationship between 2 components, in which A trusts that B has a set of properties
- Trustworthiness - The measure of how much a components meets a set of properties
- Distributed trust - A relationship in which a component is made trustworthy thought the means of distribution the system

# Byzantine Fault Tolerance

A byzantine fault is defined as when a system deviates arbitrarily from its specification, in a nutshell, a failure that can lead to anything happening.
In order to try to prevent this type of fault, byzantine fault tolerant systems usually implement some way to the system to know the order of the operations that happened.
For this to be useful the system needs to be made in a way such that
$$(State_{i+1},reply)=Service(State_i,request)$$
Which means that given an action and a state the next state of the system will always be the same 
The order of the operations is usually stored in a structure following some properties
- Can't insert/modify blocks of operations
- Can't delete blocks in the middle of the chain of operations
- Can't modify other hosts chain of operations
An example of this type of structure is a blockchain

With this in mind the main problem of this entire system is how do hosts agree in which order the operations arrived, and which order they should be stored.
For this we implement consensus algorithms, which are algorithms that try to make the system come to a consensus regarding the actions that are happening on the system.

## Byzantine Consensus

Byzantine Consensus is the name of the problem, in question before.
In this problem each process is provided a methods called propose, which allows process A to propose a value to be agreed upon, and that returns a value regarding if the other member of the system agreed with that value or not.

This type of consensus provides some properties
- Validity - If all correct values propose the same value v, v will be decided
- Agreement - No 2 correct processes can decide different values
- Termination - All correct processes will decide on a value

## Distributed System models

Considering a usual definition of distributed systems:
- A set of processes sharing some part of its state
- Processes communicate through bidirectional links, which can be shared memory or broadcast networks
- Has a system model which is chosen to increase coverage of the system

When considering how to implement fault tolerance in these distributed systems there are some facts we need to have in mind
- The system model will determine what assumptions we can make about the system and what we can do in said system. Because of this they need to be carefully defined
- Reliable channels don't exist in the real world only fair channels
- Reliable broadcasts can be implemented without timing assumptions
- Replication needs consensus
- Consensus is equivalent to atomic order

With this in mind we must take into account that in our failure model
- Processes will crash in a byzantine way
- Communication can be accepted as reliable and authenticated

# Byzantine fault tolerant distributed systems

Based on byzantine general problem

## Byzantine Agreement

To be able to root out byzantine faults we make usage of Byzantine agreement.
To come to an agreement, the BA protocol operates in synchronous rounds, and in each round all members of the system send each other messages.
Our goal will be that all correct members of the system agree on a single value, despite the traitors attempts

We will now see why the BA protocol make use of rounds

### No rounds

Lets say the protocol was implemented without rounds
In our situation lets consider 2 scenarios. 
First with 3 general and second with 4
![[Images/BA No rounds 1.png|400]]![[Images/BA No rounds 2.png|400]]
As we can see in both scenario the presence of the attacker is able to sway the way the consensus resolves.
It is easy to see how this could scale to even 5,6 or 7 general, and in all situations the traitor can control the outcome of the algorithm

### Rounds

When making usage of rounds we must now understand the purpose of each round
- The first round will be used to vote on value they want to choose
- The second round will be used to come to an agreement in what each general voted on
Take for example the following execution
![[Images/BA correct 1.png|400]] ![[Images/BA correct 2.png|400]]
In 1 C disperses the message 1 to all other members, they after try to agree in which message C send among each other.
Take into account that the traitor will try to cause as much disruption as possible
In 2 the traitor tries to disrupt the message sending conflicting messages, but because of the second round, the other members of the network can clearly see thought this ruse and understand the the traitor sent conflicting messages

### Authentication

Lastly, and even though BA doesn't use this approach normally, the usage of authentication can easy the execution of the algorithm significantly.
While in the previous scenario we couldn't be sure of a general was sending the message it received or changing it for his won means, with the usage of digital signatures we can make sure that the message general B sent to general C is the same general A sent to general B.
This obvious assumes that signatures can be forged, and that messages with invalid signature are discarded
