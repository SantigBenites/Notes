# Notes

This is my notes repository I don't want to have to organise it 

I write all my notes in obsidian so it wont look too good in GitHub

Git push command copy paste
```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "Message"
git push origin main
```

Git pull command copy paste
``` shell
git pull origin main
```
