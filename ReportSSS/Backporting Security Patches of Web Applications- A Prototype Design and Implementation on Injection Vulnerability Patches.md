In the process of development of web applications it is common for these applications to use older versions of web frameworks, this bring about problems when security flaw need to be solved in these frameworks. The reason for the lack of updates comes from a fear by developers of breaking functionalities by updating to newer versions.
This being said, it is therefore common for websites to have vulnerabilities, not by poorly written code, but by not updated code.
In this way, it would be advantageous if there was a way of patching security flaws in a way that could be propagated not only to newer versions of the framework,but also to older version so that websites running these older version could be safe.
For this exact purpose, researchers created Skyport, a application that tries to back-port patches to current frameworks into older versions.
The general process of execution of Skyport works in 4 steps.
Firstly, we extract all sink functions, i.e., those vulnerable ones that might be fixed by the patch.
Secondly, lists all sink functions in a given version and performs a symbolic tracking of the output sink capabilities (i.e., reaching conditions and data-flow expressions) for all the functions.
Thirdly executes back port Analysis based of the reaching conditions.
The process of back port Analysis consists of 
	1-  Create a SBP(Safely Back portable patch)
	2-  See if the SBP can be turned into a SBV(Safely Back portable Version)
	3-  Deploy the new SBV
With this execution of Skyport the researchers where able to back port 100% of the SBV, and with decent efficiency. Moreover, the resulting new version were always able of defending against the vulnerability the patch was created for and moreover where always compatible with the older version of the SBP.

If further research was done into this topic in the future 3 topics of distinction that could be approached would be:
- Considering Skyport is designed for PHP applications, there would be interest into extending this approach into other types of framework (Node.js, Java ...)
- The usage of Skyport can lead to more fragmented version of web frameworks, which can lead to management problems, solutions to this fragmentation would be advantageous
- Skyport is currently works by identifying subset relationships between reaching conditions and data-flow expressions, which can lead to false negatives, the solutions for this problem would require alterations to the string solvers used.
