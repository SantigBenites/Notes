# Kerberos


Kerberos is an authentication service which can run in distributed systems.

It uses a KDC (Key Distribution Center) and therefore resorts to symmetric encryption.

There are 3 main entities in kerberos, Kerberos system, the users and the KDC.

The main goal of kerberos is to mutually authenticate both the client and the server

It has the following requirements:
- Security - An eavesdropper can't listen in on the conversation or impersonate a user
- Reliability - Kerberos should be reliable enough for users to always be able to make requests
- Transparency - Other than password, authentication should not be seen by the users
- Scalability - High number of clients and servers should be supported

## Keys

Both the user and the server store a master key:
- The user generates the master key from its password
- The server can generate from a password or from a random number

The KDC's job will be to store all keys for all users and server.
The KDC also has a master key, normally generated from a password, which is used to encrypt the database of keys.

## Kerberos Operation

The process of accessing a server in kerberos is composed of 3 parts

1. Client connects to Authentication Server and request a ticket for the TGS(Ticket Granting Service), receives the ticket for the TGS and a session key to use with the TGS
2. Client connect to Ticket Granting Service and requests a ticket for Server S by sending the ticket of the TGS, receives the ticket for the service and the key to use in the connection with the service all of this encrypted with the key returned from 1.
3. Client connect to the Server and sends the ticket and an operation to be made, the operation needs to be encrypted with the key received in step 2.

All these messages are accompanied of timestamps and nonces which are used for both authentication and security.
