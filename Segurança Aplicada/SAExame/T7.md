# RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)

RFID is an automatic identification method which relies on radio signals to indetify a device.

Normally RFID uses a tag and a reader, the reader sends an indentification signal through radio which is received by the tag who responds to the signal with its ID.

## Tags

These tags are usually composed of 2 parts:
- an integrated circuit responsible for memory storage and signal modulation
- an antenna responsible for receiving and responding to signals

Normally the bigger the tag, the more powerful the antenna and therefore the bigger the area at which it can be picked up the signal it produces

Some examples of usage of tags are:
- cards
- key fobs
- retail packages

Depending on the application several things can change between tags:
- Frequency - Depending on the power transmission can go from 30hz to 900hz
- Data - Can be read-write or just read
- Format - Can be open source or proprietary
- Storage - From a couple of bytes to megabytes

There are 3 main types of tags
- Passive tags - Don't have battery and user near field to obtain a power source
- Active tags - Have a battery and usually have more reliable communication and range, but at a bigger size
- Battery Assisted Passive Tags - Have a battery for memory and microchip but require proximity to get the energy required to transmit and receive data. Usually have a longer lifetime that active tags and have increased range.

## Readers

Readers compose the other side of the equation, their purpose is to transmit/receive signals.

They try to map all devices in range and iterate between them to try to find a signal matching the required parameters.

## Protocols

Currently, with the widespread usage of RFID, many protocols have been made to address the problems with this tecnology.

They usually revolt around location of tags.


# Applications

## Identification of Products

RFID tags can be used in large surfaces as a way to track products and their prices. Minimizing both labor of memorizing prices and fraud/theft

Some significant privacy concerns are referenced regarding tags, lets say a situation where a tag is bought with a product, if  the client returns to the store the tag might reactivate itself, this information can be used maliciosly to make a customer profile based on the tags he bought.


Some solutions are referenced to this problem:
- Deactivate tags after purchase
- Encrypt tag content

Moreover the storage of tag ID in the tag can also cause problems:
- Given ID's are limited, ID's will have to be rewritten which can lead to an id for an item being confused with the previous id of the last item who used it.
- Tags can be zero'd by an attacker which can lead to no tags being usable

This problems need more complex solutions, usually in the form of authentication protocols

An example of a protocol is Zero-Knowledge Auth Protocol:
- In which there is a shared secret between the reader and the tag, and a timeframe (usually a counter)
- The protocol goes as follows
  1. Use shared secret to get a session key
  2. Authenticate using the session key
  3. Receiver sends $Count, (SessionKey\;XOR\;HASH(Count\;XOR\;SharedSecret)),HASH(SessionKey\;XOR\;SharedSecret)$ 
  4. Tag Responds $HASH(SessionKey\;XOR\;SharedSecret\;XOR\;Coutner)$

More parameters can then be added to the protocol by XORing and hashing them with the SessionKey

## Passports

Passports are one of the usual cases of usage of RFID, they usually employ passive tags.

This makes it harder for attackers to forge passports given the RFID tag must also be updated.

Some normal problems are:
- Identification of nationals by their RFID tag
- Skimming of passports

Normally to solve this types of problems, metal bands and random tag numbers can be used to better mask the identity of the user or to make it more dificult to read the tag without the passport being opened.

Moreover there is a specific protocol to be used when accessing RFID's in passports, called Basic Control Protocol:
- Initially we need a Passport encryption key $K_E$
- The reader then sends to the tag a request for a challenge
- The tag sends back a nonce, N1
- The reader generates a key $K_2$
- The reader encrypts N1,N2,$K_2$ using $K_E$, N2 being a new nonce, and also sends a MAC
- The tag verifies N1 and generates $K_1$
- The tag encrypts N2,N1,$K_1$ using $K_E$, and also sends a MAC
- The reader verifies the MAC and N2
- Both the reader and the tag obtain $K = K_1\;XOR\;K_2$

This key will then be used for communication

## Cards

RFID are normally used as identification for door readers to allow access to a building

These are very useful in comparision to other approaches to the same problem

This being said they are vulnerable to a normal attack vector a MITM attack

This attack's main purpose will be to copy a real card to this effect 2 approaches can be executed:
- The tag will respond if the correct frequency is played close to it, so if an attacker emits the correct frequency it can read the data signalled from the card and reuse it at a later date to fool the reader
- By means of a partner, the attacker can again simulate the frequency of the reader, which is then passed the the partner which is near the victim. The partner also simulates the frequency and then gets the response from the card which is then passed on to the attacker to be used on the reader

To deal with these attacks we need to either do it a posteriori, by means of analysing the positions a card could be in.

Or use some other tecniques to try to make the attacker job more difficult
- Using metalic bands around the card
- Add a authentication mecanism to the card like a PIN
- Monitor the users and see if the card is being used at an abnormal time interval or location.
