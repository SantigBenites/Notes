# SSL/TLS

TLS depends on 2 principles/entities:

## Certificates

Public key certificates are a strucuter whoose purpose is to associate a specific public key to a specific user

The ensure:
- Integrity of the certificate
- Correct association

Many standards are defined for certificates but amongst the most prominent are X09

These certificates are structered by having multiple atributes like:
- Serial Number - unique to each certificate
- Issuer Name - Has the name of the Certification Authority
- Subject Name - Has the name of the user
- Extensions - Allows for extension of the certificate with new field
- Signature - Digital signature made with the private key of the CA

## Certification Authority

Its purpose is to create and associate certificates to users.

Notice that the CA is responsible for the entire lifetime of a certificate and therefore is the only responsible for their creation and revocation

# TLS 1.3

## Handshake

The purpose of the handshake procedure is to negotiate the parameters of the connection and to authenticate the server and optionally the user.

### Phase 1 - Key Exchange

TLS allows for multiple key exchange protocols like:
- (Elliptic Curve) Diffie hellman
- Public Symmetric Key
- Public Symmetric Key with (Elliptic Curve) Diffie hellman

In order to execute the key exchange 2 messages are sent:

Client -> Server : ClientHello
- version - All supported TLS versions
- random - nonce from the client
- cipherSuite - list of supported symmetric cipher paris for AEAD
- additional info
  1. Key Material - Regarding previously defined keys

Server -> Client : ServerHello
- version - largest supported TLS version supported by both client and server
- random - nonce generated by the server
- cipherSuite - selected symmetric cipher
- key material - indicates that if a key was established it can be used 

### Phase 2 - Server Parameters

In this phase 2 messages are sent from the server to the client

EncryptedExtensions, which sends information about extensions not related to the cryptographic parameters and which are not related to certificates

CertificateRequest, which requires certificates from client if it decided to authenticate, and which send parameters regarding desired certificates

### Phase 3 - Authentication

In this step both sides send 3 messages to one another, from client to server and from server to client.

Certificate, which contains the X509 certificate and the supporting chain

Certificate Verify, which contains a signature over all handshake messages sent so far

Finished, which contains a MAC over the entire handshake

## Record

The record protocol purpose is to protect the traffic between the 2 parties.

It does this by dividing traffic into blocks which are then protected independently using the traffic keys

There are 3 steps in the protocol
- Divide the traffic into blocks/records
- Protect the records
- Transmit the result

When the receiver receives the results it verifies them, reassembles and transmits them to upper protocols

In order to verify the authenticity of our blocks we use a function called AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data) which is used to sign data with a key a nonce and extra data which can then be confirmed by the receving party

## Other modes

There are 2 other operation modes for TLS

Resumption
- After the Authentication the server can send an PSK identity
- This identity can then be used in future handshakes to configure the session
- Useful for muttiple HTTP sessions concurrently

0-RTT Data, which allows for users to send data on the first flight, it can only be used when the server and the client already share a PSK.
