cyber phisicial systems in sequence to computational advancement
cyber phisicial systems are systems whose operations are monitored and controlled by an outside core

## Cyber Physical systems chracteritics
- Cyber physical system coupling (CyberSystems dependadnt on CyberSystems) named Systems of Systems
- Interactions between commmunications/computing/control
- Secutiry and Privacy needs
- Dependadbility of operation, certified by some cases

## Why use CPS (Cyber physical systems)
- Embedded computers allow additional computational capabilities to physical systems
- Merging computational and communication with physical processes adds benefits to the CPS
- Technological and Economic Drivers

## Challenges
- Dependability on physical system

## Real-time
Real-time in CPS is the need to synchronise the actions of our system with the outside environment
This doesn't mean that the system works as fast as possible, it only means that the temporal constraints of the environment are met by the system

There exist multiple types of real-time systems
- Hard real time - timing failures must be avoided
- Soft real time - occasional timing failures can be accepted
- Mission critical real time - Timing failures should be avoided and occasional failures are handled

### Real-Time Design 
- Time-related concepts and paradigms
- Model enforcing timeliness
- Scheduling
- Communications
- Input-Output
- Dependability
