# Real Cyber physical systems

In real CPS's we make usage of micro-controllers to control the CPS

Micro-controller have multiple components inside it, one of which is the microprocessor
In a nutshell, microcontrollers are small computers with intergrated memory, I/O, perfiferal and core.
Microprocessors can be seen as the CPU of the microcontroler and serve the same purpose in the intergrated computer.

# Micro controllers

## I/O

Can be implemented in 2 wats
- Port - Device registers are mapped to ports, with separate address spaces
- Memory Mapped - Device registers are mapped onto regular address space

Using port I/O we have the advantage of not being able to have our memory space invaded by outside processes
In contrast, mamory mapping uses OS memory protection mechanisms
