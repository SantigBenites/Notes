# What are CyberPhysical Systems

CyberPhysical systems are a type of physical end engineering system whose operations are monitored, coordinated, controlled and integrated by a computing and communication core.

They integrate communication, control and monitor of real entities with computing processes.

# Challenges

- Compositionality - System properties can be inferred from local component properties
- Composability - Component properties don't change from interacting with other components
- Heterogeneity - The CPS can have heterogenous components
- CPS should not be products - this can lead to design flow problems
- Security issues - Using part of the CPS to compromise the entire system

# Real Time Systems

A real time problem is a type of problem in which we need to coordinate our actions with an environment

In other words, a system whose progression is stated in terms of timeliness requirement defined by the environment

RT is not
 - Ad-hoc design
 - Automata
 - Requiring speed


There are 3 main classes of RT systems
- Hard RT - Timing failures must be avoided
- Soft RT - Ocasional timing failures
- Mission Critical RT - Timing failures must be avoided and ocasional failures must be handled with exceptions

Fault tolerance composes part of a RT system given that if a system fails it won't be able to meet the required deadlines.
