# Control Systems

## Introduction

A control system is part of a CPS which is configured to provide a desired system response.

There are 2 main types of control systems:

Open-loop which uses a controller and an actuator to provide the desired response:
- Actuator - Acts over the real system
- Controller - Causes the Actuator to Act

Closed-loop which uses the error from actuator as input for the controller, the error is calculated by measuring the desired output and comparing it with the real output response.

The process of designing a control system is multi-phased
- Establish control goals
- Identify variables to be controlled
- Write Specifications
- Establish system configuration
- Obtain models of the process
- Describe controller and select parameters
- Optimize parameters

## Modelling Physical Systems

To accurately obtain "models of the process" as indicated above we need to define quantitative models with describe our physical system. 

These models usually are mathematical models given our systems have a physical nature and therefore are based on the law of physics.

There are 2 main types of models
- Continuos - Provide continuos evolution of the model
- Discrete - Provide evolution of the system at discrete intervals

## Continuos Models

Since most models represent dynamic relations in nature, we usually use differential equations as means to describe our systems

This because most physical laws are modelled on the basis of differential equations.

Newton's Law - The sum of all forces in a system equals to zero

Models are usually defined by some concepts:
- state - small set of n variables with initial values at $t_0$, such that for $t>t_0$ the system can be described using only those variables and their values.
- state vector - vector of the derivatives of n in time t
- state space - n-dimensional vector with the variables of the state, represented by $x(t)$
- state trajectory - trajectory of $x(t)$ as it evolves
- transfer function - function able to describe entire state of system based on input, for continuous models we normally use a laplace transform to get it.

Depending on the model we are trying to model different rules/equations will need to be applied.

Some properties of continuous systems
- Causality
  1. Causal system - Output depends only on current and past inputs, and not in future inputs
  2. Strictly causal - Output depends only on past inputs, and not in current or future inputs
- MemoryLess
  1. System with memory - Output depends on current, past and future inputs (if not causal)
  2. System without memory - Output at time t depends of inputs at time t
- Linearity - System is linear if it satisfies
  1. Superposition - Given $y_1(t)=f(x_1(t))$ and $y_2(t)=f(x_2(t))$ then $y_1(t) + y_2(t) = f(x_1(t) + x_2(t))$
  2. Homogeneity - Given $y(t)=f(x(t))$ then $B(y(t))=B(f(x(t)))$
- Time-Invariance - A system is invariant of time if gives output which doesn't depend on time
- Stability - This is true if for all bounded input signals the system gives bounded output signals
