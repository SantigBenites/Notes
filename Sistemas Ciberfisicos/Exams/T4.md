# Discrete Models

The usage of discrete data comes very naturally to computers given this is the type of data they usually manage

To convert continuous signals into something thr computer can understand we have to pass it through many steps:
- Analog signal
- Sample data signal
- Quantized signal
- Digital signal

The conversion is done:
- Analog -> Sample data -> Quantized -> Digital
- Digital -> Sample data -> Quantized -> Analog

The conversion between types of signals between the real environment and the computer is usually done using specific hardware:
- Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)
- Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)

In a closed loop system this type of hardware could be placed as such:

Their purpose will be to convert real data into something comprehensible by the computer (ADC) and to convert computer commands into something understandable by the sensors (DAC).

## Digital controller Implementation

This type of controller usually works based on difference equations which are the discrete time equivalent to differential equations.

$$u[k+1]=f(e[0],...,e[k],e[k+1]; u[0],...,u[k])$$

They take as parameters the accumulated error over time until the current time, and the values os the controller output until time-1.

Just like we use laplace transform in differential equations to convert them to transfer function, Z transform is used in difference equations to convert them into transfer functions.

Considering we can easily do the inverse property of both the laplace transform and the Z transform this means we can convert the Discrete systems to Continuos and the other way around.

In a nutshell we can model continuos systems as discrete, using this method.
Taking into account it will only be an aproximation of the real system, and that we are sampling values to make the transition.
