# Complex Networks and Systems

Behind complex systems there is usually a networks that expresses the interactions between the components of the system.

### Network Science
In our days this field is usually used to simulate data that we can observe in reality, the data for the simulation can be passed as quantitative data, or mathematical models.

### Networks (Graph Theory)
In graph theory each node is an entity of the problem, each link is a relationship between nodes.
Relationships can be Reciprocal, Nonreciprocal, weighted or temporal
Each node has a strength related to how many connections(relationships) it has.

### Random and Small World

Adding randomness to networks can be represented by _Add thing from slides_ . This can be seen when in a graph we rewire connections between nodes in order to make a new graph

## Networks

Six Degrees of Separation,  is experience in network theory indicating that with small changes in a network we can simulate the relationships between all people on earth

Scale free networks, are networks were a small amount of nodes hold the majority of the connections of the network

### Centrality Measures

Centrality measures, are a measurement of a network that helps us identify important nodes and relationships in complex networks, these usually help identify common structures in networks.
These measurements can be used to analyse the impact of something in the network, something that usually happens by chance, take for example anywise how many links we can remove before the network collapses.

### Communities and Clustering

These can be used to analyse relationships between nodes, and relationships between groups of nodes giving a better understanding of the general outlook of the network, giving the possibility to discover links that are not obvious in the network.
Communities are characterised by having many internal links and therefore their nodes are highly connected.

# Bacterial Population Evolution

## Biological Model

## Simulation and Computational Models

In each node, we have a population with an individual, with a certain profile composed of alleles. These alleles will have a certain mutation and recombination rate.
Given a smaller network we can see that overtime, in contrast to what was expected the diversity of the nodes isn't always maxed, in some points the diversity drops significantly.

## Main observations

This can be generalised to mean that there will be fluctuations in genetic diversity
