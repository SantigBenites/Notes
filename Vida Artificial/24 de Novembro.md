# Self Regulation in  agent communities


## Self Organization

For a system to eb able to have self organiztion it requires the existance of:
	-Active components (agents)
	-Agents capable of producing global begaviour
	-Agents not directly instructed
	-Behaviour emerging from a set of components

From these rules we can derive some general guidelines
	1.No external control
	2.Order manipulation
	3.adaptability
	4.interaction
	5.asynchronism

This type of aprach can lead to improvements in simplicity, considering the organiztion doesnt require complex coordenation, efficiency, considering the organiztion will need less parts in general, and fault tolerance considering its a byproduct of this type of system organization.

## Self Regulation

Self regulation is added to self Organisation, and its the property of the agents of a system to change their own behaviour depending to the behaviour of the other elements of the population.

## Stigmergy

Stigmery is an alteration of SO and SR, but in this case instead of the agent perceiving the envireoment and changing it self, the agent changes the environment.
One agent by themselves would have much influence, the interesting scenario is when the group of agents is big enought that overtime they are able to change the environment so that the action of other agents changes.

## Effects

-> Homestasis - is the counter effect to SO and SR, it tries to maintain the status quo of the system countering change 

-> Free Riders - Elements of the system (agents) who try to do the oposite of what the sytem is trying to do, leading to change
 - Non Cooperating agents
 - Their action is not always on par with the "intent" of the system and not always "beneficial"
 - But the change they make is normaly usufull


# Swarm

http://fcampelo.github.io/EC-Bestiary/ -> all computational algorithms, maybe they should try to evolutionize a life

swarms are defined as self organised multi agent systems with an emergent behaviour

in these models there are some general rules of thumb
- large number of agents
- each agent with simple behaviour
- complex behaviour emerges from the colony
- macroscopic behaviour emerges from SO
- distributed decision without the need for central control

In the example of ants there is use of stigmergy for the communication through pheromones, these because the changes of the environment though these pheromones influence the behaviour of the agents

## SO Mechanisms

1. Positive Feedback - amplifying effect, like when a ant leaves a pheromone trail to increase fluency to a certain path
2. Negative Feedback -  Stabilising or counter effect, like when a ant says the food as ended, killing the fluency to the path
3. Random Fluctuation -  Some random path may be amplified by chance like when a ant is exploring
